# Overview-DeltaModels-Biomedical-IR
An overview of Delta models which are state-of-the-art models of Information Retrieval in the field of Biomedicine.
This is a survey of the two Delta Models proposed for information retreival in the field of Biomedicine. The two research papers that are being surveyed are:
1. Deep Learning for Biomedical Information Retrieval: Learning Textual Relevance from Click Logs (https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W17-2328/)
2. A Fast Deep Learning Model for Textual Relevance in Biomedical Information Retrieval (https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3178876.3186049)
